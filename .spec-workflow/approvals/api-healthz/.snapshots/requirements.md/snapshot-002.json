WHEN a client sends `GET /healthz` THEN the system SHALL respond with HTTP 200 and body `{ status: \"ok\" }`.\n2. IF the request is unauthenticated THEN the system SHALL still respond with HTTP 200 and body `{ status: \"ok\" }`.\n3. WHEN the service is running THEN the system SHALL respond without performing any external dependency checks.\n\n## Non-Functional Requirements\n\n### Code Architecture and Modularity\n- **Single Responsibility Principle**: The health check handler should only return service status\n- **Modular Design**: Route definition should follow existing API routing patterns\n- **Dependency Management**: Avoid introducing new dependencies for this endpoint\n- **Clear Interfaces**: The route and handler should be easy to locate and understand\n\n### Performance\n- The endpoint should respond quickly and avoid unnecessary computation.\n\n### Security\n- The endpoint should not require authentication and should expose only minimal status data.\n\n### Reliability\n- The endpoint should return a successful response as long as the service is running.\n\n### Usability\n- The endpoint should be consistent and predictable for monitoring tools.\n",
